# I Know It!
This is a web application that simulates a fuctional ask and answer forum. Questions are broken down into posts that are created within sections of the application. Advice can be given in the form of a comment to all posts. When a user provides an advice the opening poster thinks works/worked best, they can select the user as knowing the answer.

I Know It! is a web application created by me, Aranvihn Clark, where users are given a platform to ask and answer questions. This web app was created as part of a Capstone Project during a Hackbright Academy Cohort. The base product is the result of two weeks of work. I will continue to build on this project in my spare time until a version is deemed deployable.
